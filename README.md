# Python Database Manipulation using SQLite

## Overview
This project uses the SQLite Python integration to create a table and manipulate the data within it. The code also captures exceptions in case of errors.

The goal of this project is to use existing programming tools to create databases without the installation of additional data analysis software, which often contains large files and may be difficult to run on all computers.

## Running the Code
1. Create a table of students with their grades. Student ID is the primary key.
2. Select all records with a grade between 60 and 80.
3. Change Carl Davis's grade to 65.
4. Delete Dennis Frederickson's row.
5. Change the grade of all students with an ID greater than 55 to a grade of 80.

## Required Installations
SQLite requires no additional installations. The code includes the import of the source code.

To visualize the table, you can use the free browser tool [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). After the code has been run, the table should look like this:
